This research has explored the incredibly vast ecosystem of cloud based computing and how it has imposed greater security risks to businesses and individuals. By using threat intelligence feeds to enhance the function of intrusion detection systems, we can employ a certain due diligence based approach to prevent security incidents. Using some or all of the features and log outputs from firewalls and intrusion detection systems, as well as native operating system logs, we can store inbound and outbound packets, flow data (consolidated packet captures), and other forensically important artifacts in the ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana) stack for visualization.

While security and vulnerabilities will always exist on network based systems, using emergent technology such as Linux Containers and Docker Engine to power the aforementioned software we can generate momentum toward making data breaches, software and hardware exploitation, phishing attacks, and other malicious actions less impactful to the cloud community and the internet as a whole.
