The cloud ecosystem has emerged as one of the most dominant technology services over the past decade. Just as much as smartphones have begun to dominate our personal lives, cloud service models have begun to replace on premises web servers, computers, databases, and file stores. With the rapid availability of shared resources on the cloud, many businesses are exposed to additional and more complex information security risks. Cloud service models such as Infrastructure as a Service, Platform as a Service, and Software as a Service introduce security risks that targets the entire scope of the OSI and TCP models, allowing a compromised host to potentially degrade the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of other systems on the network. Analyzing log files and presenting them in an easily digested manner is imperative to preventing data breaches and other security incidents. This research reviews several emergent technologies and presents an improved defense in depth approach, log analysis, and visualization to improve the security of cloud based systems.
