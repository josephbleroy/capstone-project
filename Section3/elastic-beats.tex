Elastic Beats are lightweight daemons written in the Go programming language. They’re used to collect and ship logs from various endpoints to Logstash. File specific Elastic Beats such as File Beat search through log paths locations specified in a configuration file, matches the log with an input type and a document type so that the logs can be easily interpreted by a filter.
