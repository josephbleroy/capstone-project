Tripwire is a very powerful and easy to use host based intrusion detection system. A host based intrusion detection system does sits on each host to monitor inbound and outbound packets, file system changes, among others. It’s the most powerful detection system for detecting insider abuse, such as disgruntled employees using administrative rights to destroy or modify files. During the configuration and installation process Tripwire creates an encrypted database where it stores a baseline image to reference against each file modification, addition, or deletion. The process of scanning an entire filesystem is relatively CPU intensive, so typically the service is run during non-peak hours.

One of the unique security features that Tripwire offers is site key file encryption to ensure configuration files aren’t modified as well as local key encryption which prevents Tripwire’s binary files from being executed without permission.
