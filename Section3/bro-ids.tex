Bro is a very unique intrusion detection system that captures packets, inspects traffic, detects attacks, and records logs for each event it encounters. What Bro also does is detect intrusions, handles vulnerability management, file analysis, measure traffic, and deals with regulatory compliance monitoring for community cloud based systems. Bro logs can be sent into a data store and be analyzed by applications such as Splunk, the ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana) stack, among others.

Using Bro as an intrusion detection system is an incredibly beneficial tool to understand network events and build or maintain situational awareness in respect to security alerts and anomalous activities. For example, when an instance of Bro is installed and configured on a host for network monitoring, a group of log files are dynamically created and populated with connection attempts, security notices, errors, and other security relevant information. After a set amount of time, the logs are compressed and stored in their own directory or data store for historical analysis.

Bro combines the principles behind many computer and network forensic tools, concepts, and best practices to form a powerful, open source solution for cloud based businesses to protect their assets while containing any vulnerabilities to a specific virtual environment, not others.
